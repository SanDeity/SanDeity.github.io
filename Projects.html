        <p>
            This is a list of some of my past Projects, which should showcase my skills and flexibility. All of my video game works are made with GameMaker Studio 2.<br>
            Don't judge the visual design of the games, I never claimed to be an artist.

        <p>
            Grenadier-521 is a space exploration game where the player controls every detailed ship command themselves.<br>
            As you can see the player can control the direction, rotation, and speed of the ship. Everything is designed on a ds_grid with realistic proportions.<br>
            This project required me to design a 3D space within GameMaker Studio 2, a 2D platform.<br>
            I learned a lot during this project and visited many ideas to make it work such as skybox mapping other sectors onto a drawn map, limited visibility, and randomly generated 'solar' systems.<br>
            Currently in this video, more than 10,000 stars are being randomly generated and drawn constantly on the screen since I left the project in a testing state.<br>
            There is also a lot of math behind the scenes, in order to accurately generate sections of a galaxy.<br>
            The ridiculous X, Y, and Z values are attributed to the current scale of the game being galactic.<br>
            I also demonstrate my organizational skills with this project, keeping track of the systems and scale. (Even if the scale of the game got out of hand, it was organized!)
            Unfortunately, a space game with realistic proportions gets out of hand very quickly and the project was put aside indefinitely.<br>
            This idea is dear to me and I continue to hope one day to be able to revisit it.

        <h2 class="section-header">AIlex: Twitch Integrated OpenAI</h2>
        <video width="640" height="360" controls autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="Videos/AIlex.mp4" type="Video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>
            AIlex is the first 'AI' chatbot I designed and rigged using OpenAI's Language Model, Google API, VTube Studio, and Twitch integration.<br>
            The entire project runs in one Python .exe (with VTube Studio and whatever recording or streaming software you use).<br>
            This particular program uses Twitch Chat commands or even just messages to format and send prompts to a language model and then reads out the model using Google's Text-to-Speech API.<br>
            The audio is then sent to a virtual sound device and monitored by VTube Studio.<br>
            The entire project is over 700 lines of code, using multithreading, writing and reading json, and much more.<br>
            Future similar projects even had Discord integration.<br>
            Highly customizable and optimized, this project demonstrates my knowledge in communicating with multiple different API's, and my organizational skills.<br>

        <p>
            This project was to learn inventory management and organize a large amount of text blocks. Scrolling text, menu navigation, UI, and more skills are demonstrated here.<br>
            I wish I had more finished projects to show off but all of the mechanics for this project are basically finished. With art assets and more writing this could be a functioning game.<br>
            I've included this because I am proud of the UI navigation and I believe that it demonstrates my organization and competence with UI very well.<br>

        <p>
            Pardon the recording for this project, it was designed to be debugged on Android, and this is how I had to record it without resizing the application and my recording software.<br>
            This is my most recent project, which I started to learn programming for Android.<br>
            I also took this opportuninty to worth with different types of pathfinding.<br>

            This concludes my 'works' page. These are only some of my game ideas put into action.<br>
            All of these projects were done alone and I loved taking on challenges and learning what I could from them.<br>
            Thank you for reading through all of my works and I hope we get to work together in the future!
