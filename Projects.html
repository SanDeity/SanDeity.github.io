        <p>
            This is a list of some of my past Projects, which should showcase my skills and flexibility. All of my video game works are made with GameMaker Studio 2.<br>
            Don't judge the visual design of the games, I never claimed to be an artist.

        <p>
            Grenadier-521 is a space exploration game where the player controls every detailed ship command themselves.<br>
            As you can see the player can control the direction, rotation, and speed of the ship. Everything is designed on a ds_grid with realistic proportions.<br>
            This project required me to design a 3D space within GameMaker Studio 2, a 2D platform.<br>
            I learned a lot during this project and visited many ideas to make it work such as skybox mapping other sectors onto a drawn map, limited visibility, and randomly generated 'solar' systems.<br>
            Currently in this video, more than 10,000 stars are being randomly generated and drawn constantly on the screen since I left the project in a testing state.<br>
            There is also a lot of math behind the scenes, in order to accurately generate sections of a galaxy.<br>
            The ridiculous X, Y, and Z values are attributed to the current scale of the game being galactic.<br>
            I also demonstrate my organizational skills with this project, keeping track of the systems and scale. (Even if the scale of the game got out of hand, it was organized!)
            Unfortunately, a space game with realistic proportions gets out of hand very quickly and the project was put aside indefinitely.<br>
            This idea is dear to me and I continue to hope one day to be able to revisit it.
