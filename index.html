        <p>
            I am Caleb Michael David Taylor (Four first names?!) or SanDeity, and I am a software developer with experience in music, management, and product assurance.<br>
            I have a passion for video games and programming, and I adore the feeling of compiling a project and watching it work as intended first try!<br>
        </p>

            I have a little baby puppy that just turned 1 year old this fall. Her name is Juno and she is a miniature goldendoodle.<br>
            I enjoy trying new things, and getting into new hobbies like rock climbing, Kendo, or playing games like Magic: The Gathering.<br>
            My favorite activities are backpacking or riding my motorcycle down country backroads while jamming out to my current favorite music.<br>
            As a video game enthusiast, some of my all time favorite games include Omega Strikers, Dark Souls, Undertale, and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, or Ocarina of Time.<br>
            I grew up skateboarding and playing the violin. I also won a junior competition for composing a piece for a local orchestra to perform.

        <p>
            Coding languages I am proficient with include C++ and Python, and I've tought myself GML (GameMaker Language), HTML, and Arduino.<br>
            I've also taken courses in French, Japanese, and Spanish, of which I am not fluent, but am continuing to learn.
